# Running Stats – Mini Data Analysis Project
## 📝Introduction

This is my first data analysis project, created shortly after learning the basics of SQL through SQLBolt. I was inspired by a YouTube tutorial that introduced me to the structure of a simple data project.
For this project, I extracted my personal running data from Strava (which I use to track my runs) using the Strava API, and analysed the data using SQL to explore patterns and insights in my running activity.

## 🌐Technologies Used
SQLite

## 💡What I Learned
* Common data formats such as CSV files and Excel workbooks
* How to work with datasets where data types are not fixed or need casting
* Using SQL functions such as ROUND() and STRFTIME() for data transformation and analysis
